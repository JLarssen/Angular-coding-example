Hello, please take notice of my 2 remarks for CR3:
	* it was not possible to use the borrowed laptop and to push the whole Ang-Project. Because
	VSC did not accept my remote Repo, please see .pic with error message (vsc changes the path of the Repo and makes a - instead of a :
	Again I sat too many hours and tried to push CR3. So I did upload the src-folder and deploy it 
	on the server.
	
	* I do feel so bad for the lobsters and other creatures in the oceans 
	who get boiled when the still are alive and eaten by humans, thereby destroying
	a lot of environment for other animals usw. usf. so I could not make a
	main site with a poor gambero rosso, I got a blockade after I started with this assignment
	and therefore had to change the main name of the restaurant. 
	
	* I have some commented code inside, because I tried to implement "clear cart" to learn a little more
	about the component cycle, but I wasn't capable to make it work. Just if you have time, pleas just give 
	some hints how one would do it right (but not so important)
	
	* tried to make a new page for 'details' with redirect and giving the route but Angular did not 
	accept the routing
